# Weight Tracker Android App
## Project Overview
The Weight Tracker app is a mobile application designed for individuals who want a simple and effective way to track their weight over time. It supports users in achieving their weight goals by providing features for goal setting, daily weight logging, and progress tracking.

## Features & Technical Solutions
The Weight Tracker app offers a streamlined solution for users to log their weight, set goals, and track progress with a simple, user-friendly interface. Key features include secure login, real-time progress tracking, and optional goal notifications via SMS. Built for Android 7.0+ devices, the app focuses on privacy by limiting permissions to only the essentials like SMS for optional notifications while storing data locally in an SQLite database for offline functionality. This app was built with a diverse user base in mind, with minimal clicks and ensures accessibility and ease of usefor users of all ages.

The development followed a modular coding approach, utilizing helper classes for efficient database management (UserDB and WeightDB) and user feedback to refine features. Robust testing on Android devices ensured reliable functionality, enabling valuable insights for that helped to create the app's clean and modern design. Future enhancements could include a data export option, more analytics and visuals, and logging reminders to help engage users and keep them on track. This project demonstrates expertise in creating a lightweight mobile application focused on core functionality and privacy.
